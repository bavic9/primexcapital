                            I enrolled into PXC Academy with minimal knowledge of Forex trading and
                            I can boldly say that I have learnt a lot. The remarkable thing is that I have
                            also been able to learn about life from a different angle. I am impressed with
                            their professionalism and approachability. Iâ€™m grateful to Jeffrey Benson and
                            the astonishing PXC Team.

                            One of the things that I truly enjoy about PXC is their constant innovation. They seem to always work
                            to provide a better service through offering their traders a wide range of services. They have launched a
                            blog which I find very interesting and their trading recommendations have been a very nice feature. Their
                            support is excellent, but honestly you will never require them as their platform is solid and I have never
                            experienced any outage or trading issues. My withdrawals are processed the same day and I very happy to manage
                            my forex portfolio with PXC.

                            I have had nothing but great experiences with PXC. I am planning on
                            traded with them for a long time. They are the most profitable broker I have
                            worked with. Also, I was always supported by their customer service, which answered
                            to all of my questions in within 24 hours. They have a great blog that
                            helped and helps me out to identify important trends in the market. Highly recommended.
